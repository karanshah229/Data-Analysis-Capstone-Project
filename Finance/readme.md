# Financial Stock Analysis

---

### Objective:
1. The objective is to analyze stock prices data of financial institutions so as to  
gather some intuition of pandas and the field of data analysis.
2. The data has been gathered from Google Finance (now stooq) using DataReader

---

### Outcomes:  
After analyzing the data, I learnt:
1. Stock price of CitiGroup crashed during the 2008 recession
2. We can see clear trends in stock prices and realise that Goldman Sachs,  
Morgan Stanley are the steady prices
3. Plotting the data also gives us more insights into the economics of these companies

#### Note:
1. This is not a complete stock market analyser
2. The data is not prepared by me and is historic data
