# 911 Calls

---

### Objective:
1. The objective is to analyze 911 calls data so as to gather some  
intuition of pandas and the field of data analysis.
2. The data can be found in 911.csv and this data was used to  
perform the analysis.

### Outcomes:  
After analyzing the data, I learnt:
1. Towns with most calls:
  1. Norristown PA Pennsylvania  
  2. Pottstown, Pennsylvania  
  3. Lansdale, Pennsylvania
  * Now, we must not jump to the conclusion that these are the most  
dangerous towns as we don't have sufficient data
2. Number of calls per category:  
    1. EMS
    2. Fire
    3. Traffic
  * This gives us good insight as to which utilities to allocate more resources to
3. The number of calls increase during evening time i.e. 5 - 9  
and the they receded during the nights suprisingly
4. Saturdays and Sundays accounted to less calls as opposed to  
other week days
5. March and July seem to be the months with most 911 calls

---

#### Note:
1. The dataset contained data only for fire, EMS and Traffic calls
2. The dataset is not current
3. The data was missing for 3 months and hence data was filled in  
trying various models to best it
